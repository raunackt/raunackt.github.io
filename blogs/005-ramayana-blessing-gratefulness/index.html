  <p>That the <em>shāstra</em>-s continuously refer to events that transpired before them is a well-known attribute. Protagonists of a story will be refered to as &ldquo;<em>narendra</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>rājendra</em>&rdquo;, etc., other such epithets which invoke Indra as a superlative, him being the king of <em>deva</em>-s.</p>
<p>There are smaller such incidents, which are just presented as off-handed comments, but are extremely deep and have entire histories attached to them. One such instance is when Rāma is about to leave for the forest, to being his <em>vanavāsa</em>, his grief-stricken mother, Kausalyā pronounces many blessings on him. She says, amongst other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>यन्मङ्गलं सहस्राक्षे सर्वदेवनमस्कृते। वृत्रनाशे समभवत्तत्ते भवतु मङ्गलम्॥</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>यन्मङ्गलं सुपर्णस्य विनताकल्पयत्पुरा। अमृतं प्रार्थयानस्य तत्ते भवतु मङ्गलम्॥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly translated as : &ldquo;Which ever auspicious portents occured to the thousand-eyed one when he destroyed Vṛtra, may those occur to you as well. Whatever auspiciouness Vinatā prayed for Suparṇa when he endeavored for <em>amṛta</em>, may those auspicious protents happen to you as well.&rdquo; While Indra&rsquo;s destruction of Vṛtra is among the greatest of <em>ārya</em> stories, acquiring new meanings and forms over long periods of time, Vinatā&rsquo;s story is comparable to Kausalyā&rsquo;s helplessness and they both share a concern for their son, endeavoring on a perilous journey.</p>
<p>Vinatā and Kadrū were the wives of Kashyapa, and the former is the mother of Garuḍa and Aruṇa, while the latter is the mother of all <em>sarpa</em>-s and <em>nāga</em>-s. Vinatā and Kadrū placed a bet, on whether Uccaishravā&rsquo;s tail is black or white. Vinatā said it to be white and Kadrū said it to be black. Considering Uccaishravā is a white horse, naturally all of his parts would also be white. So a case can be made that Kadrū does not know her current affairs. Irregardless, they put on this wager, went over to check on the all-white-horse-with-nothing-black-on-him and Kadrū cheated by asking her sons, the snakes to cover Uccaishravā&rsquo;s tail, which made it appear black in color, thus &ldquo;defeating&rdquo; Vinatā. The condition was whoever was wrong in her guess, would become the slave of the other. Hence Vinatā was now Kadrū&rsquo;s slave.</p>
<p>Kadrū and her sons began to order Vinatā and Garuḍa around accordingly. Needless to say that the latter pair was dejected and after a few adventures of unreasonable requests, Garuḍa asks his half-brothers what would it take to be freed from this slavery. The <em>sarpa</em>-s replied that if Garuḍa bring to them the <em>amṛta</em> of the <em>deva</em>-s from <em>svarga</em>, he and his mother would be free. Garuḍa relayed the same to his mother who pronounced the following blessings unto him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>पक्षौ ते मारुतः पातु चन्द्रः पृष्ठं तु पुत्रक। शिरस्तु पातु ते वह्निर्भास्करः सर्वमेव तु॥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning: &ldquo;Let the Maruts protect your wings. O son! Let the moon protect your back. Let the fire protect your head. Let the sun protect all your body.&rdquo; And also that she would always pray to bring him welfare. Saying that these prayers &ldquo;worked&rdquo; is an understatement. Both Garuḍa and Rāma would bring nothing but destruction to their enemies after their endeavors. Garuḍa also became the <em>vāhana</em> of Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>In another instance, <em>pravacanakāra</em>-s to justify Rāma&rsquo;s quality of being &ldquo;<em>kṛtajña</em>&rdquo; (Rāmāyaṇa 1.1.2) cite a story from Bhāgavata Purāṇa. In the 6th <em>adhyāya</em> of 9th <em>skandha</em>, the Ikṣvāku <em>vansha</em> is described. One king of this lineage is Puraṅjaya. The <em>devatā</em>-s and <em>dānava</em>-s were at it again, you know the usual, and they request help from Puraṅjaya. The latter agreed on the condition that Indra would become his <em>vāhana</em>. Indra obviously refuses at first but the at behest Viṣṇu agrees. Indra takes the form of a bull, and Puraṅjaya sits on his back, <em>kukud</em>. They won their fight against the <em>dānava</em>-s and since Puraṅjaya had sat on the back of Indra, he came to be known as Kakutstha, meaning &lsquo;stationed on back&rsquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>पुरंजयस्तस्य सुत इन्द्रवाह इतीरितः। ककुत्स्थ इति चाप्युक्तः शृणु नामानि कर्मभिः॥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Rāma descends from Puraṅjaya, he is called &ldquo;<em>Kākutstha</em>&rdquo;, much like how he is called &ldquo;Dāsharathi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rāghava&rdquo;, thus expressing gratitute to Indra and his ancestor.</p>
<p>These are small things, but a little curiosity goes a long way.</p>
